# Epilogue

Our little tour of Rust ends here.

There are many things we've seen any even more things we haven't yet. Rust is a language with a large surface area, and an even larger ecosystem! 

Don't let this scare you, though: there's no need to learn everything. You'll pick up whatever is necessary while working on your projects.

## Going further

Let's close with some pointers to additional resources that you might find
useful as you move forward in your journey with Rust.

> We have create a **full** free Rust course: **["100 Exercises To Learn Rust"](https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/)** that teaches Rust from the ground up and covers everything you need to know!

### Exercises

You can find other exercises to practice Rust in the [`rustlings`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
project and on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io)'s Rust track.

### Introductory material

Check out [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and
["Programming Rust"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)
if you're looking for a different perspective on the same concepts we covered throughout this course.
You'll certainly learn something new since they don't cover exactly the same topics; Rust has a lot of surface area!

### Advanced material

If you want to dive deeper into the language, refer to the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)
and ["Rust for Rustaceans"](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans).\
The ["Decrusted" series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFirH9armw8yXlE6dacF-A6z) is another excellent
resource to learn more about the internals of many of the most popular Rust libraries.

### Domain-specific material

If you want to use Rust for backend development,
check out ["Zero to Production in Rust"](https://zero2prod.com).\
If you want to use Rust for embedded development,
check out the [Embedded Rust book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/).

### Masterclasses

We offer several masterclasses on key topics hat cut across domains.\
For testing, check out ["Advanced testing, going beyond the basics"](https://rust-exercises.com/advanced-testing/).\
For telemetry, check out ["You can't fix what you can't see"](https://rust-exercises.com/telemetry/).
