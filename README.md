# Dev dependencies

- Rust should be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- After that add the Wasm target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Install the following tools:
  - trunk (e.g. through `cargo install --locked trunk`)
  - watchexec (e.g. through `cargo install --locked watchexec-cli`)
